  <h2> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
  <div class="center">
    <p>Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of people around you. There are five key elements to EI:
     <li> self-awareness</li>
     <li> self-regulation</li>
     <li>motivation</li>
     <li> empathy</li>
     <li>social skills</li>

<h2> Why is Emotional Intelligence important?</h2>
<div class="center">
<p class="quotation">"being human is tough"</p>
<p> Susan David’s talk on emotional agility and the power it delivers is inspirational. Her personal story of grief and loss, and her radical acceptance of difficult, unpleasant emotions helps paint a clear picture of emotional intelligence.

  The accuracy with which people label their emotions is essential for mining those emotions for data and later aligning them with personal values.</p>

  During my research I find this TED talk really great to watch and it provide the “6 steps of improving your Emotional Intelligence”:
 <ol type="1"> <li> Build awareness to a level of unconscious competence.</li>
  <li> Differentiate and analyze emotions.</li>
  <li>Accept and appreciate emotions as signals.</li>
  <li> Reflect and find the origin.</li>
  <li>Handle the emotions.</li>
  <li>Then handle the emotions of others.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>What's now:</h2>
<div class="center">
<p>
  notes to myself:

  1. Realization of suffering as a part of life. We all have a choice in how we understand pain. Instead of uttering, “*why me?*” it is important to say, “*why not me?”* Hard times can happen to anyone at any time. We have two choices in how we handle that suffering: apathy, which means we end up wallowing in the pain, or growth. The second choice gives us the opportunity to heal through it, learn from it, and live on with resilience.
  2. Selective attention to what is changeable and what is not. This does not diminish the pain, but rather is a choice to intentionally tune into the good. It is focusing on social support in hard times. It is hunting for the benefits in any situation.
  3. “*Is what I’m doing helping or harming me?”* Hone encourages anyone suffering to be mindful of their behavior and to choose only what will help. Emotional intelligence is understanding that this awareness is vital to growth.</p>
