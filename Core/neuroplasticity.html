        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>Neuroplasticity can be viewed as a general umbrella term that refers to the brain's ability to modify, change, and adapt both structure and function throughout life and in response to experience. </p>
          <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>A growth mindset is “the understanding that abilities and understanding can be developed” . Those with a growth mindset believe that they can get smarter, more intelligent, and more talented through putting in time and effort. </p>

  <h2> Relevant to learning:</h2>
  <div class="center">
    <p>In general, the relation between neuroplasticity and learning is an easy one to surmise—when we learn, we form new pathways in the brain. Each new lesson has the potential to connect new neurons and change our brain’s default mode of operation.<br>

      It help establish connections between neuron and our brain: with practice and activity or using our brain to adopt some complex activities, it help our neural networks to create electrochemical pathways, so our neuro cells wire togtehr and fire together leading to a more efficient and stronger brain network.<br>
      
      It will nix the rote memorization and help individual able to memorize the complex concept or knowledge for long term uses.<br>
      
      It help shaping our mindset and gain motivations: -When individual generally be more motivated when they knew that they were all fully physically capable of building knowledge and changing their brains.

<h2> How to grow?</h2>
<div class="center">
  <p class="quotation">"Practice, practice, practice"</p>
  <p> Put information in context

    Research and understand that this is how the brain works.
    
    base on my research things you can do to improve: *Intermittent fasting, Using mnemonic devices, Learning a musical instrument, on-dominant hand exercises, Reading fiction, Expanding your vocabulary, Creating artwork,*1. Memory tasks and games, Challenging brain activities like crosswords or sudoku…..</p>
  <p> For more information, I read about the list below"eight general approaches for developing the foundation for such a mindset”:</p>
    <ol type="1"> <li> Create a new compelling belief: a belief in yourself, in your own skills and abilities, and in your capacity for positive change.</li>
      <li>View failure in a different light: see failure as an opportunity to learn from your experiences and apply what you have learned next time around.</li>
      <li> Cultivate your self-awareness: work on becoming more aware of your talents, strengths, and weaknesses; gather feedback from those who know you best and put it together for a comprehensive view of yourself.</li>
      <li>Be curious and commit to lifelong learning: try to adopt the attitude of a child, looking at the world around you with awe and wonderment; ask questions and truly listen to the answers.</li>
      <li>Get friendly with challenges: know that if you mean to accomplish anything worthwhile, you will face many challenges on your journey; prepare yourself for facing these challenges, and for failing sometimes.</li>
      <li>Do what you love and love what you do: it’s much easier to succeed when you are passionate about what you’re doing; whether you cultivate love for what you already do or focus on doing what you already love, developing passion is important.</li>
      <li>Be tenacious: it takes a lot of hard work to succeed, but it takes even more than working hard—you must be tenacious, weathering obstacles and getting back up after each time you fall </li>
      <li>Inspire and be inspired by others: it can be tempting to envy others when they succeed, especially if they go farther than you, but it will not help you to succeed; commit to being an inspiration to others and use the success of others to get inspiration as well (Zimmerman, 2016).</li>
      </ol>

<h2>My thought on neuroplasticity</h2>
<div class="center">
  <p>
    Notes to myself:

    After reading about the different between growth mindset and fixed mindset. It help me self-reflect on some of the moment in my life before. In this scenario fixed mindset approach was the go-to solution for me. Where I dont really notice at time. And it does somehow shape the way I received and process information day-to-day. 

    In the future, if I can convert and intentionally train my brain to adapt growth mindset. I see the long term positive effect it will have. and help me focus on problem solving in stead of self-questioning.
