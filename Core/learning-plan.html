    <h1> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
        <p> I am planning to change my career path in next five year. In longterm UI or UX designer will be a great option, but at the moment I do see front-end developer as a great starting points for this transformation.
        
        I would say the destination at this point is able to step into the industry and start to practice what I learn.</p>
        
        <h1> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
        <p>Below is what I wrote for sprint 2I think it still apply. But also I do find at sometimes it hold me back when I trying to apply the “design mind” to the coding. Will be interesting see how I switch my hat completely.<br>

          I think it still apply. But also I do find at sometimes it hold me back when I trying to apply the “design mind” to the coding. Will be interesting see how I switch my hat completely.
        </p>
      
        <h1> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
        <p>
          Teamwork will be hard, as I personally could be the baggage dragging my team down.<br>

          My time management skills is not shape enough to mange this intensive study yet, but I believe it could be developed during bootcamp.<br>
          
          Keeping focused will be quite challenging as well.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h1>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
        <p>
          Able to communicate efficiently and clearly will be a great skill to gain, consider how bootcampe structured.<br>
Able to developing my leadership skill which I personally find really useful while doing project.<br>
        Trying to solve it by myself first as it is a great to understand the problem better. and learn to set a limit to how long you trying to figure it out by yourself. 15minutes is a good ideal, and learn to cut at a good point where you need to seek for help from discord or the facilitator.<br>
        </p>
        <h1>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
        <p>
          I expect to get feedbacks, good or bad, and it will light the path a bit during the study.
        </p>
        <h1>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp </h1>
        <p>
          - I expect myself able to get the job done. Enjoying the learning.  And having fun.

To achieve that, I need to :<br>

1. Better time management skill<br>
2. Learnt to plan things and follow the plan.<br>
3. Something done is better than something perfect.(nothing is perfect)<br>
4. Be aware of what’s going on and keep practice mindfulness.<br>
