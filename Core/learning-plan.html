  <h2> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  <div class="center">
 <p>I am planning to change my career path in next five year. In longterm UI or UX designer will be a great option, but at the monment I do see full-stack developer as a great starting pointg for this transformtaion.</p>

  <h2> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
  <div class="center">
  
 <p>I have a good base of understanding some of the design concept, such as color, alignment etc. spatial design in general is a strengths.

  limitation: focus too much to the design at this stage will limit the learning narrative.</p>

<h2> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
  <div class="center">
 <p>
  Make a plan at the beginning of each sprint base on the initial insight of what the goal is set for. Following existing timebox and learn to break it into a detailed version when need. 

  Continually review and reflect what been achieved in the end of the day, even just a quick rewind of what the notes is about for the day.

  <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
  <div class="center">
 <p>
  Trying to solve it by myself first as it is a great to understand the problem better. and learn to set a limit to how long you trying to figure it out by yourself. 15minutes is a good ideal, and learn to cut at a good point where you need to seek for help from discord or the facilitator.
