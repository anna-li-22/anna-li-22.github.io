    <h1> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
    <p>I am planning to change my career path in next five year. In longterm UI or UX designer will be a great option, but at the moment I do see full-stack developer as a great starting points for this transformation.</p>
    
    <h1> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h1>
    <p>I have a good base of understanding some of the design concept, such as color, alignment etc. spatial design in general is a strengths.
    limitation: focus too much to the design at this stage will limit the learning narrative.</p>
  
    <h1> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h1>
    <p>
    Make a plan at the beginning of each sprint base on the initial insight of what the goal is set for. Following existing timebox and learn to break it into a detailed version when need. 
    Continually review and reflect what been achieved in the end of the day, even just a quick rewind of what the notes is about for the day.
    </p>
    
    <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
    <p>
    Trying to solve it by myself first as it is a great to understand the problem better. and learn to set a limit to how long you trying to figure it out by yourself. 15minutes is a good ideal, and learn to cut at a good point where you need to seek for help from discord or the facilitator.
    </p>
    <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
    <p>
    Technical support and able to give feedback when needed will be great.
    </p>
    <h1>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. </h1>
