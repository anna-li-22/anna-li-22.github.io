    <h1> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>
    <p>
        <li> I do enjoying code and the problem solving is fun.(and it's hard too)
        </li>
        <li>I am more productive when I am focused.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mindset play a big part in this learning process, and it is really important to constantly reflecting..
        </li>

    <h1> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
    

    <p>
      Base on my experience during the age of unpredictable(pandemic and everything happening around me). <br>

      <strong>Values</strong> is really important, because it keep bring you back to the core of whatever you do in life. While programming, you values not just help you overcome the challenge part and but also help you re-think about what’s important so you can keep evolving you problem-solving skill.<br>
      
      <strong>Self-awareness</strong>, from my understanding, will shape you perspective constantly during you programming process. The one who can reflectively think about themselves will able to move further.<br>
      
      <strong>Empathy</strong> is the action of understanding, being aware of and being sensitive to the feelings of others. It is a important skill especially during the COVID-19, it is powerful. We learning a new language  where we trying to let the computer understand us. That’s the cold, robotic part of the technology. It will only be helpful and able to make life better when we as human-being able to care and be empathetic. Without that,  it’s just lines of code, AI will able to do it as well.<br>

      <h1> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
      
      <p>I think I am surprised about how this core leaning skills is relate to day to day life as well.

        I know it is generally phycological-ish training for mindset tailored for this intensive program. But I do see how it start to bring the ‘order’ back to my day-to-day life.

      <h1> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
      <p>
        I think it is to convert long-existing working mindset to learning. As we do learn stuff while we working or doing any job. But actually block time to learnt and jump in to a completely new era is challenging. Neuroplasticity and growth mindset is really nice to pick up and I see why it is really important. But like most other useful stuff in life, you do need to practice it (training you mind), which could be challenging as at the moment. if (speed of learning <expectation; questions > ability to abort new knowledge;) mindset ≠ growth mindset…

      </p>
      <h1> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>
      <p>
        Because,  hard skills make you a programmer, but soft skills make you a good programmer.
      </p>
      <h1> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answe</h1>
      <p>
        Not at all.

        I prefer to practice core. For example, during the foundation, I pick up meditation, it helped me to look inside and practice my mindfulness. In a way, it help me focus better and also when things are challenging it help me to get through it then just give up or panic.
