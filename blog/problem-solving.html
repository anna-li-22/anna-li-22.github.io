    <h1> When I blocked on a simple problem:</h1>
    <div class="center">
      <p>I stuck on what to do on the first step where we need to add the score to the new object. 

        From there I reading the error message, I find we need to add the array to the new object we just create.  I don’t understand how to add an array to the object.  So I googled how to add the array to the object as new value.  With so many solution and I dont undertand most of them. I go back to check what we learnt on sprint 3. And the basic of array and object….
        
        And use Pseudocode but on piece of paper to list the steps I need to follow to achieve what I want.
        
        after couple hour, I realize I am not getting anywhere with googling. So I turn to discord and see thread already talking about it. reading through other peoples process, I finial get it.
        
        To be 100% honest, I do feel like I am stupid mostly because it is the first step and suppose to be really “simple”  Which is not the best feeling in the world.
        
        I learnt I need to be honest to myself, where I always think I can do it by myself especially in problem-solving and understand “you don’t know what you don’t know”.<br>
        
        note for the week: ask for help is not shameful.

  <h1> When you elegantly solved a problem.</h1>
  <div class="center">
  <p>
    During sprint 4, when I doing the built-in method.

    Where I trying to process the function capitalize(sentence).
    
    I start with writing Pseudocode as my guideline to start with and also make sure I understand what the goal of this function by reading the error message.
    
    And following the Pseudocode I start to step by step trying to the goal for each steps. where I use console.log to see the outcome of each step make sure it is matching the Pseudocode.
    
    and from there, I only need to focus on solving a subdivide smaller problem. that’s where I google and also it’s often more efficient when I know what to search. And in the end with the group session, I solved the problem.
    
    Throughout the process, I do feel less frustrated when I know what to ask and what to expect for each step. And solving smaller problems is better than stuck in a big one. 
    
    What I learnt is: understanding the question is really important and should always be the first step for lots of the problem. And from there, trying to break the big problem into smaller one is really good (with Pseudocode especially), it will take the weight of self-questioning when facing tricky questions, and gain the focus back to solving itself.

    <h1> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h1>
    <div class="center">
      <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
      <div><span>How confident:</span>
        <meter min="0" max="100" value="70">70%</meter>
      </div>
    <p>Pseudocode is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms

    <h3>Trying something</h3>
    <div><span>How confident:</span>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="70">70%</meter>
    </div>
  <p>From my understanding, it means we keep trying different method and solution and normal it help you gain knowledge for your problem.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
    <div><span>How confident:</span>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="50">50%</meter>
    </div>
    <p>Sometimes it is really helpful to read it out couples times as it help you understand the structure of the problem. I talk to my partner sometimes as a reminder of what the problem is really about. <br>
  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
    <div><span>How confident:</span>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="60">60%</meter>
    </div>
  <p>This method is really helpful. Especially when the testing code is in place(as in this sprint). It almost like providing an quick feedback on what's working and what's not. But at this stage, sometimes it make the case more complicated as I dont understand some of the error yet.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
    <div><span>How confident:</span>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="60">60%</meter>
    </div>
  <p>Console.log() help me understand where I am when doing or applying function. Also able to show me the outcome of the manipulating process. where I am able to spot what's working.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <h3>Googling</h3>
    <div><span>How confident:</span>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="90">90%</meter>
    </div>
  <p>Most of the time this is the method I use while trying to figure out the problem. And often it is helpful. The only concern is sometimes when I don't understand what to search it will lead you to wrong path.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
    <div><span>How confident:</span>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="40">40%</meter>
    </div>
  <p>As I am alway trying figure out stuff myself and always overthink about other people might be busy about stuff themself. I often do not encourage myself to ask for help. At this stage, consider how hard this course is for me, I do feel this method is helpful and enable to save time for me.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
    <div><span>How confident:</span>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="50">50%</meter>
    </div>
  <p>It is the same feeling for the peers one. And I need to change my mindset to "the coaches is here to help", and stop feeling like it is not good to ask question.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
    <div><span>How confident:</span>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="50">50%</meter>
    </div>
  <p>I need to do better on this. At the moment, it is helpful to reflect in the end of the day or each test. But sometime when reflecting, I do feel like I did not understand something and end up spend lots of time figure out the particular part. What will be beneficial for me at this stage is to let reflection be the opportunity of having a overall list of what's working and what's not first. And zoom into those stuff afterwards.
