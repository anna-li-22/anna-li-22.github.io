  <h2> An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
  <div class="center">
    <p>The relationship that Javascript has with HTML and CSS is like the structure of the leave.
    
     <li> An **HTML file**
      Contains the structure of the leave itself. It is kind of like the structure of the leave.
      </li>
      <li>A **CSS file**
       contains the styling of the leave. It allows you to change colors, positioning and more. It is kind of like the leave varied from margin, shape, blade, tip, color and even petiole size.
      </li>
      <li>
      A **JavaScript file**
      Determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the leave. It determines what happens when season changed, what happen when bug and insect bite the leave, and how it react when using spray and environment factor changed.
      </li></p>

<h2> The DOM</h2>
<div class="center">
<p>
  DOM is a document object module document that refers to the HTML document. 

  HTML and CSS are two of the fundamental languages found almost everywhere on the web. The Document Object Model provides the means to interact with objects in an HTML document.
  
  When a web page is loaded, the browser creates Document Object Model of the page.
  
  It's a "tree" of objects, with JS objects representing the head, body, title, paragraphs, etc.
  
  as image illustrated below:<br>

  <img class="small-image" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210908120846/DOM.png" alt="tree">
  <br>
  With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
  <ol type="A">
  <li>JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page</li>
  <li>JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page</li>
  <li>JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page</li>
  <li>JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes</li>
  <li>JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes</li>
  <li>JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page</li>
  <li>JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page</li>
  </ol>
</p>

  <h2> Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects: what are they?</h2>
  <div class="center">
    <h3>objects:</h3>
  <p>In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
    ”Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.”
  <p class="code">
    const vegetable = {type:"lettuce", color:"green",size:”small”};
  </p>
  </p>
  </div>
<div class="center">
  <h3>array:</h3>
<p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:
<p class="code">
  const vegetables = ["broccoli", "lettuce", "cucumber"];
</p>
</p>
</div>
<div class="center">
  <h3>loop:</h3>
<p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:<br>
  instead of:<br>
<p class="code_two">
  text += cucumber[0] + "<br>";
  
  text += cucumber[1] + "<br>";
  
  text += cucumber[2] + "<br>";
  
  text += cucumber[3] + "<br>";
  
  text += cucumber[4] + "<br>";
  
  text += cucumber[5] + "<br>";
</p>
<p>loop it with:<br></p>
<p class="code_two2">
 
  for (let i = 0; i < cucumber.length; i++) {
    text += cucumber[i] + "<br>";
  }
</p>
</p>
</div>
<h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
<div class="center">

<p>Control flow in JavaScript is how your computer runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line, unless it hits any statement that changes the control flow of the program such as loops, conditionals, or functions. 
<p class="code">
 It's like cooking rice. Start from decision of "rice for dinner", and we decide what ingredients we need(brownrice, jasmine rice, coconut rice), and then decide how we cook(ricecooker, pot) it and then what other ingredients needed(water,slat, surger)
and by making the loop of rice cooking.
Imagine we have 6 tons of rice, so we start to loop where all the rice will be cooked with our decisions till no rice is left in the pile.
